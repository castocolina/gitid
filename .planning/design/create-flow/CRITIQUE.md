# CRITIQUE.md — create-flow (pilot surface)

**Reviewer note:** the executor's toolset in this session was limited to
`Read`/`Write`/`Edit`/`Bash` — no `Task`/subagent-dispatch tool was available to
spawn a fresh-context `agent-ui-ux-designer` subagent (same limitation recorded in
02-01-SUMMARY.md / 02-02-SUMMARY.md). In its place, this critique applies
`agent-ui-ux-designer`'s documented methodology (F-pattern/left-side bias,
Fitts's/Hick's Law, accessibility, distinctive-not-generic typography) directly
against the captured `.planning/design/create-flow/html/*.png` and
`.planning/design/create-flow/tui/*.png` screenshots, and fills the structured
parity findings log against `FIELDS.md` and `parity.json`. **This does not
substitute for a fresh-context `agent-ui-ux-designer` pass** — flagging explicitly
so the phase-level `/gsd-code-review` and the external cross-vendor review can
re-run one if the orchestrator has that capability this session lacked.

## Surface: `create-flow`

## A. Aesthetic / usability pass (HTML mockup only)

- **Reviewer:** this executor, applying `agent-ui-ux-designer`'s documented
  methodology directly (Task/subagent dispatch unavailable — see note above)
- **Screenshots reviewed:** all 12 `.planning/design/create-flow/html/*.png`
- **Findings:**
  - **F-pattern / left-side bias:** every screen's primary content (form fields,
    algorithm list, command output, ceremony copy) starts flush-left at the same
    `px: 2` inset as the shared shell body, with the live-preview / secondary
    panel to the right on the two guided-form screens (`ssh-form-filled`) — matches
    the two-archetype layout contract (UX-DIRECTION Section 2). No finding.
  - **Fitts's Law (target size/reachability):** form fields and the algorithm
    catalog's `Paper` rows are full-width, generously padded (`p: 1.5`/`p: 2`)
    targets — no undersized click targets. No finding.
  - **Hick's Law (choice count):** the algorithm catalog presents exactly 5
    options with one visually distinguished as the recommended default (green
    border + "best/default" chip) — reduces the effective decision to a single
    obvious choice plus 4 clearly-secondary alternatives, not an undifferentiated
    5-way pick. No finding.
  - **Accessibility / never-color-alone:** every colored state (success green,
    warning yellow, error red) pairs a glyph (✓/!/✗) with a word, matching
    02-UX-DIRECTION.md Section 2's color-semantics table — verified on
    `test-fail.png` (red ✗ + "Permission denied"), `confirm-write.png` (yellow
    warning triangle + "Nothing has changed yet"), `backup-notice.png` /
    `result-success.png` (green check + word). No finding.
  - **Distinctive-not-generic typography:** the terminal-skin theme (monospace
    JetBrains Mono, flat borders, zero elevation) reads as a screenshot of a
    real terminal tool rather than a generic Material dashboard, consistent
    with the anti-slop stance (UX-DIRECTION Section 1). No finding.
  - **Minor observation (not a parity finding — HTML-only cosmetic):** on
    `ssh-form-blank-prefix.png` and a few other single-column screens, a large
    area of empty space remains to the right of the ~480-640px content column
    on the 1280px capture viewport. This is consistent with the guided-form
    archetype (form column + preview column, where the preview column is
    intentionally empty when there's nothing to preview) and is NOT a §3
    MUST-match dimension (§3: "exact spacing, pixel layout... MAY differ").
    No action needed; noted for awareness only.

## B. Structured parity findings log (HTML ↔ TUI, every named state)

Reviewed all 12 `html/*.png` against their `tui/*.png` counterpart, cross-referenced
against `FIELDS.md` and `parity.json`'s eight §3-dimension rows.

| Finding # | Dimension (parity.json key) | Screen | Description | Status | Resolution |
|-----------|------------------------------|--------|--------------|--------|------------|
| 1 | (observation, not a §3 dimension) | all 12 | The TUI shell header (`renderShellHeader`, shell.go) renders only the app name + breadcrumb — it does not render the `N identities · ✓ healthy` context chip the HTML `Header.tsx` shows. This is a pre-existing 02-02 shell-infrastructure characteristic that applies uniformly to every dummytui surface (not introduced by create-flow, not fixable within this surface's own files), and the context chip is not one of §3's seven MUST-match dimensions (field set/order, labels/copy, option sets, defaults, flow order, safety affordances, keybindings) nor the surface's highest-risk affordance. | resolved (no action required — out of §3 scope) | Logged for awareness; not a parity.json row because it falls outside the §3 rubric. If a future phase wants header-chip parity, it is a 02-02-owned shell.go change affecting all surfaces uniformly, not a create-flow-specific fix. |

No other divergences found. Every §3 dimension (field set/order, labels/copy,
option sets, defaults, flow order, safety affordances, keybindings) and the
surface's highest-risk affordance (test-confirm-backup-boundary) matched between
media on direct screenshot-pair review — see `parity.json` for the per-dimension
resolution notes.

**0 open findings** — `.planning/design/create-flow/parity.json` has no row with
`status != "resolved"` (verified: `python3 -c "import json; r=json.load(open('.planning/design/create-flow/parity.json')); assert r and all(x['status']=='resolved' for x in r)"`).
