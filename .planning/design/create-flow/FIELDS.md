# FIELDS.md — create-flow (pilot surface)

Per-screen field-parity manifest for the create-identity flow (02-UX-DIRECTION.md
§4.1's 12 named states, lifted verbatim). This is the DLV-01 spec: it is authored
BEFORE the mockup/dummy screens and doubles as their contract. `agent-ui-ux-designer`
fills the **HTML present** / **TUI present** columns after both media exist and both
screenshot sets are captured (Task 3).

The machine-checkable gate is `.planning/design/create-flow/parity.json` (§3
dimensions + the `test-confirm-backup-boundary` row) — this document is its
human-readable companion.

## create-flow / git-form (02-14 atomic copy freeze)

**Goal:** the wizard's Git-identity step-3 buttons and their adjacent hint
lines — the FROZEN single source of truth is
`02-STYLE-SPEC.md` §4; this row is the create-flow human-readable companion
(the machine-checkable proof is the repo-wide old-copy grep gate, `02-STYLE-SPEC.md` §6).

| # | Field | Label | Order | HTML present | TUI present | Notes |
|---|-------|-------|-------|---------------|--------------|-------|
| 1 | `wizard_back_button` | "Back (Esc)" | 1st | ✓ | ✓ | unchanged, not part of the freeze |
| 2 | `wizard_skip_button` | `[ Skip Git ]` | 2nd | ✓ | ✓ | frozen (02-14 atomic copy freeze); the explanation moved off the button onto its adjacent hint line |

| 4 | `wizard_continue_button` | `[ Continue ]` | 3rd | ✓ | ✓ | frozen (02-14 atomic copy freeze); the explanation moved off the button onto its adjacent hint line |
| 5 | `wizard_continue_hint` | "Continue reviews the Git fragment, includeIf, and allowed_signers entries before writing." | adjacent to Continue, always visible | ✓ | ✓ | frozen hint line, `hint`/`Theme.Hint` role |

## 02-STYLE-SPEC.md emphasis-role parity dimensions (round-2/round-3 feedback)

**Goal:** the six new checkable parity dimensions
`02-STYLE-SPEC.md` §3 defines — the content parity gate (the rows above)
never modeled emphasis roles, focus affordance, or keyboard-nav ergonomics;
these six rows are that missing coverage's human-readable companion. Backed
by the Go test suite in `internal/dummytui` (see `02-STYLE-SPEC.md` §3 for
the exact test-name pattern per row) plus a fresh `agent-ui-ux-designer`
critique of the two live demos.

| # | Dimension | HTML present | TUI present | Notes |
|---|-----------|---------------|--------------|-------|
| 1 | `typography-emphasis-roles` | ✓ | ✓ | label bold, hint dim, warning/error/info carry their semantic colors on both sides |
| 2 | `field-contour` | ✓ | ✓ | focused field carries an accent contour; blurred fields carry a dim contour — never a border on every field |
| 3 | `hint-persistence` | ✓ | ✓ | the match-strategy hint is reserved and never disappears when the select expands/focuses |
| 4 | `arrow-nav` | ✓ | ✓ | the written precedence rule (02-STYLE-SPEC.md §2), identical in both media, incl. the Shift+←/→ focus-override chord |
| 5 | `preview-sizing` | ✓ | ✓ | bounded width, optional fixed height with a clip cue, title in the border/top edge |
| 6 | `dim-states` | ✓ | ✓ | disabled-nav dims header chrome while a pane captures keys; the active nav tab keeps its active-nav accent background (checkpoint feedback U1); the active pane carries the active-area accent |
